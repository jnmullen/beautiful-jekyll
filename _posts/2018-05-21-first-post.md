## My journey to the cloud

This is the first post of what I am hoping will be many! I'm going to try and use this blog to test out forcing me to into writing of my experience moving to the cloud and testing out some things I have wanted to investigate.

Just over one year ago I started a new job in which pretty much everything was cloud first. This was quite a change to my previous roles where I had either been dealing with large physical server installations (the largest being around 300 servers) or laterly dealing with virtualised ESXi installations.

In the year which has passed I have learnt a fair amount about AWS from my day to day work. Along with that day to day experience and some learning time outside of work I managed to pass my first AWS certification - AWS Solution Architect Associate. On the back of this I have already booked the Developer Associate exam.
