## Passed my second AWS certification!

So having passed my Solutions Architect certification a couple of weeks ago, I managed to pass the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam today.

Those who have already taken these exams will know there is quite a large overlap between the Solutions Architect and Developer Associate exams, in reality the main topic I had to level up on was DynamoDB as there are a lot of questions on this area.
